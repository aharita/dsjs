# dsjs.js

This project is for educational purposes, more than production like material.

I created this library to learn more about the Javascript world, and try to learn more about the language itself.

## Node

```javascript
var n = new dsjs.Node();
n.value = 10;

## LinkedList

```javascript
var l = new dsjs.LinkedList();
var n = new dsjs.Node();
l.addFirst(n);
